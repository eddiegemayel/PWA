		<h1>Validation Check</h1>
			<p>Here are 4 websites and how they stacked up against the html validators.</p>
		<h2>Youtube(www.youtube.com)</h2>
			<p>Youtube failed both html validators. Html Lint found 210 errors, while Validations found 58 errors. Most errors included missing end tags on links. The programmers could easily fix these problems, just by not being lazy and adding end tags.</p>
		<h2>Bright House(http://brighthouse.com/central-florida/default)</h2>
			<p>Bright House failed both html validators. Lint found 30 errors, while Validations found only 11 errors. The errors included missing end tags and capitalized attributes. The web designers just need to double check their end tags and make sure they are correct.</p>
		<h2>Wikipedia(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)</h2>
			<p>Wikipedia passed both html validators with 0 errors. They created very nice and neat html code.</p>
