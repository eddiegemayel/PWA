			<p>Here are 4 websites and how they stacked up against the html validators.</p>
		<h2>Youtube(www.youtube.com)</h2>
			<p>Youtube failed both html validators. Html Lint found 210 errors, while Validations found 58 errors. Most errors included missing end tags on links. The programmers could easily fix these problems, just by not being lazy and adding end tags.</p>
