		<aside>
			
			<p>Joe Rogan is quite the man of legend. Rarely do you see someone who has done so much in so little time. He has had many jobs over the years, and it is quite impressive. For starters, Joe has done comedy since the late 80's and hasn't slowed down since. He recently released a new comedy special last year, which you can find on his site for only $5. Secondly, Joe has been a commentator for the Ultimate Fighting Championship for over <strong>15 years</strong>! That's a lot of UFC fights that he has commentated. But it doesn't stop there; Joe has his own Podcast show with over 300 episodes in total, each about <em>2-3 hours long</em>. He has had a variety of interesting guests on his podcast, ranging from musicians to scientists. In addition to the famous podcast, Joe has also been on TV shows, like hosting Fear Factor, and more recently, his own show on the Syfy network, "Joe Rogan Questions Everything". How does he do it all?</p>
