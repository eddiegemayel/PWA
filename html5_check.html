			<h1>HTML5 Check</h1>
		</header>	
		<h2>1. Alex Catalan's site</h2>
		<p>URL: http://4lex.cat/</p>
		<p>This is a site promoting the web designer Alex Catalan. The site contains his/her work, and ways to contact him/her</p>
		<h3>Screenshot</h3>

		<p>Did they use HTML5 correctly? Yes partially.</p>
		<p>The only thing I saw wrong was that he/she had sections instead of a nav. The navigation appeared to be hidden or something. He/she could have maybe added a nav to make navigating the site easier.</p>
		<h2>2. Every Last Drop</h2>
		<p>http://everylastdrop.co.uk/</p>
		<p>This site is trying to raise awareness about water usage in the UK.</p>
		<h3>Screenshot</h3>

		<p>Did they use HTML5 structural elements correctly? They used divs everywhere they could, but for this site I believe it was correctly used. Since this site was about just scrolling down and being interactive, it had no titled sections, but I believe it was intended or intentionally ignored.</p>
		<h2>3. Wayne Rooney</h2>
		<p>http://www.officialwaynerooney.com/</p>
		<p>This is an awesome looking site about the famous Futbol striker Wayne Rooney.</p>
		<h3>Screenshot</h3>
		<p><img src="images/rooney.jpg" alt="screenshot three" width=711 height=391 title="screenshot of Wayne Rooney site"/></p>
		<p>They used the HTML elements correctly. They had the proper nav implemented. All their sections in the outline were properly named and in order.</p>
