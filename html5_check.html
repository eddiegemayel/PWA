			<p>Did they use HTML5 correctly? Yes partially. Seemed some nav elements were missing. Also in the outline, some sections were untitled.</p>
		</div>
		<!-- First Site -->
		
		<div class="site2">
			<h2>2. Every Last Drop</h2>
			<p>URL: http://everylastdrop.co.uk/</p>

			<p>Did they use HTML5 structural elements correctly? They used divs everywhere they could, but for this site I believe it was correctly used. Since this site was about just scrolling down and being interactive, it had no titled sections, but I believe it was intended or intentionally ignored.</p>
		</div>
		<!-- Second Site -->
		
		<div class="site3">
			<h2>3. Wayne Rooney</h2>
			<p>URL: http://www.officialwaynerooney.com/</p>
			<p>This is an awesome looking site about the famous Futbol striker Wayne 	Rooney.</p>
			<h3>Screenshot</h3>
			<p><img src="images/rooney.jpg" alt="screenshot three" width=711 height=391 title="screenshot of Wayne Rooney site"/></p>
			<p>They used the HTML elements correctly. They had the proper nav implemented. All their sections in the outline were properly named and in order.</p>
		</div>
		<!-- Third Site -->
		
		<div class="site4">
			<h2>4. Dodge Dart</h2>
			<p>URL: http://dodgedartregistry.com/</p>

			<h3>Screenshot</h3>
			<p><img src="images/dodge.jpg" alt="screenshot four" width=710 height=391 title="screenshot of Dodge Dart"/></p>
			<p>Correct HTML5 was implemented here. Honestly could find nothing wrong. Titled sections were named properly as well.</p>
