		<p>Did they use HTML5 correctly? Yes partially.</p>
		<p>The only thing I saw wrong was that he/she had sections instead of a nav. The navigation appeared to be hidden or something. He/she could have maybe added a nav to make navigating the site easier.</p>
		<h2>2. Every Last Drop</h2>
		<p>http://everylastdrop.co.uk/</p>
		<p>This site is trying to raise awareness about water usage in the UK.</p>
