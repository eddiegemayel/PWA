		<h2>1. Alex Catalan's site</h2>
		<p>URL: http://4lex.cat/</p>
		<p>This is a site promoting the web designer Alex Catalan. The site contains his/her work, and ways to contact him/her</p>

		<p>Did they use HTML5 correctly? Yes partially.</p>
		<p>The only thing I saw wrong was that he/she had sections instead of a nav. The navigation appeared to be hidden or something. He/she could have maybe added a nav to make navigating the site easier.</p>
